# Brings good news and bad news
 
Due to COVID 19, it has become very hard to fly back to China from the US. Planes are limited and cancelled but the risk of catching virus during the flight remains high.This project is created for a friend who's tracking the lastest news on delta airline's official update page, and will give him a call using **twilio**'s awesome library for Python. It reads the website with **request** library, and it uses the **lxml** library to parse the html constantly provided with xpath to the elements.
